# Toxic Comment Filtering with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning model for detecting and filtering toxic comments from text data. It leverages a Sequential model built using TensorFlow and Keras, along with essential preprocessing techniques and data pipelines to achieve high accuracy in toxic comment classification.

## Features

- Data Loading and Preprocessing: Efficient handling of text data, including tokenization and padding.

- Deep Learning Model: A Sequential model built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify comments as toxic or non-toxic.

- Data Pipeline Optimization: Use of caching, shuffling, batching, and prefetching for faster training.

- Visualization: Insights into model performance through metrics such as accuracy and loss.

- Gradio: Incorporation of the model in a gradio app for actual usage

## Libraries Used

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and performance analysis.

Scikit-learn: For additional preprocessing and evaluation metrics.

Gradio: For interface

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, and then set up the required libraries:

```
!pip install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
## Dataset

The dataset contains comments labeled as toxic or non-toxic. The data includes text fields and corresponding labels for supervised learning. [Include a source or link if dataset is publicly available.]

## How It Works

Data Loading: Load the dataset and perform initial preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values).

Tokenization and Padding: Convert text data into sequences of integers and pad them to ensure uniform input size.

Model Building: Construct a Sequential model with embedding layers, LSTM/GRU (if applicable), and dense layers for classification.

Training: Train the model on the preprocessed data using techniques like batching and optimization with Adam optimizer.

Evaluation: Test the model's accuracy and visualize metrics using plots.

### Usage

To run the project, execute the cells in the Jupyter notebook in order. The notebook includes:

- Installation commands

- Code for data preprocessing

- Model training and evaluation sections

## Results

The model achieves a significant level of accuracy and effectively identifies toxic comments. [Include specific metrics or graphs, if available.]

### Future Improvements

- Incorporating additional NLP techniques like lemmatization or stemming.

- Experimenting with advanced model architectures such as Transformer-based models (like BERT).

- Extending the model to handle multi-label classification for various toxicity types
